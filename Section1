Lecture 1:
Introducing MERN Mediastream::
--This will be a simple video streaming application that allows registered
users to upload videos that can be streamed by anyone browsing the application.
--We will add new React components to implement views for uploading a new video,
listing already posted media, modifying media post details, and displaying a video
where users can interact with the video content to stream and watch it. We will also
modify existing components such as the Home component so we can render a list of
popular videos and the Profile component so we can list all the videos that are
posted by a given user. These uploading and streaming capabilities in the application
will rely on the user's ability to upload video content
