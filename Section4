Lecture 1:
Custom media controls::
--We will add custom player control elements below the video rendered in the
MediaPlayer component and manipulate their functionality using the options and
events provided by the ReactPlayer library.

--we will
implement the play, pause, and replay controls; the play next control; the loop
functionality; volume control options; progress control options; fullscreen option, and
also display full duration of the video and the amount that's been played.

Play, pause, and replay::
--Users will be able to play, pause, and replay the current video. We will implement
these three options using Material-UI components bound to ReactPlayer
attributes and events.

--To implement the play, pause, and replay functionality, we will add a play, pause, or
replay icon button conditionally depending on whether the video is playing, is
paused, or has ended.

--The play, pause, or replay icons are rendered in this IconButton based on the
outcome of the ternary operator

Play next::
--Users will be able to play the next video in the related media list using a play next
button, which will render depending on whether the next video is available or not.
--Clicking on this play next button will reload the PlayMedia component with the new
media details and start playing the video.

Loop when a video ends::
--Users will be able to set the current video to keep playing in a loop, using a loop
button. The loop button will render in two states, set and unset.
