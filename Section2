Lecture 1:
Listing Media:
--we will add list views of relevant media with a snapshot of
each video to give visitors easier access and an overview of the videos on the
application.
--We will set up list APIs in the backend to retrieve different lists, such as videos
uploaded by a single user and the most popular videos with the highest views in the
application. Then, these retrieved lists can be rendered in a
reusable MediaList component, which will receive a list of media objects as a prop
from a parent component that fetches the specific API.

The MediaList component::
--The MediaList component is a reusable component that will take a list of media and
iterate through it to render each media item in the view. In MERN Mediastream, we
use it to render a list of the most popular media in the home view and a list of media
uploaded by a specific user in their profile

--media list component we use it to render two different lists of
media: a list of popular media and a list of media posted by a specific user. In the next
section, we will look at how to retrieve a list of popular media from the database to
render it in the frontend.

Listing popular media::
--For popular media, we will set up a route that receives a GET
request at /api/media/popular.

Listing media by users::
--To be able to retrieve a list of media that's been uploaded by a specific user from the
database, we will set up an API with a route that accepts a GET request at
'/api/media/by/:userId'
