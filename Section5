Server-side rendering with data::
Lecture 1:
SEO is important for any web application that delivers content to its users and wants
to make the content easy to find. Generally, content on any web page will have a
better chance of getting more viewers if the content is easily readable to search
engines. When a search-engine bot accesses a web URL, it will get the SSR output.
Hence, to make the content discoverable, the content should be part of the SSR
output.

--we will use the case of making media details popular across
search engine results, to demonstrate how to inject data into an SSR view in a MERNbased
application. We will focus on implementing SSR with data injected for the
PlayMedia component that is returned at the '/media/:mediaId' path. The
general implementation steps outlined here can be used to implement SSR with data
for other views.

--We will first define a
static route configuration file and use it to update the existing SSR code in the
backend to inject the necessary media data from the database. Then, we will update
the frontend code to render this server-injected data in the view, and, finally, check if
this SSR implementation works as expected.
