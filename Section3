Customizing the Media Player and Improving SEO
-->In this chapter, we will;
--Customizing player controls on ReactPlayer
--Playing the next video from a list of related videos
--Autoplaying a list of related media
--Server-side rendering (SSR) of the PlayMedia view with data to improve
--search engine optimization (SEO)

----After completing these topics, you will be more adept at designing complex
interactions between React components in a frontend user interface, and also at
improving SEO across your full-stack React applications.

Lecture 1:
Adding a custom media player to MERN Mediastream::
--we will update the view that plays media with a customized
ReactPlayer and a related media list that can be set to play automatically when the
current video ends.

The play media page::
--When visitors want to view specific media on MERN Mediastream, they will be taken
to the play media page, which will contain the media details, a media player to
stream the video, and a list of related media that can be played next.

The component structure::
--We will compose the component structure in the play media page in a way that
allows the media data to trickle down to the inner components from the parent
component. In this case, the PlayMedia component will be the parent component,
containing the RelatedMedia component and also the Media component, which will
have a nested MediaPlayer component.

--When individual media links are accessed in the frontend of the application, the
PlayMedia component will retrieve and load the corresponding media data and list
of related media from the server. Then, the relevant details will be passed as props to
the Media and RelatedMedia child components.

--The RelatedMedia component will list and link other related media, and clicking
any media in this list will re-render the PlayMedia component and its inner
components with the new data.

we will add a customized media player as a child component. This
customized MediaPlayer component will also utilize the data passed from
PlayMedia to stream the current video and link to the next video in the related media
list.

--In the PlayMedia component, we will add an autoplay toggle that will let users choose to autoplay the videos in the related media list, one after the other. The
autoplay state will be managed from the PlayMedia component, but this feature will require the data available in the parent component's state to re-render when a video
ends in the MediaPlayer nested child component, so it can be ensured that the next video starts playing automatically while keeping track of the related list.

--To achieve this, the PlayMedia component will need to provide a state updating
method as a prop that will be used in the MediaPlayer component to update the
shared and interdependent state values across these components.

Lecture 2:
Listing related media::
--When a user is viewing an individual media on the application, they will also see a
list of related media on the same page. The related media list will consist of other
media records that belong to the same genre as the given video and is sorted by the
highest number of views.

The related media list API::
--we will use the listed related method  in the PlayMedia component to retrieve a list of media related to the current media loaded in the media
player. Then this list will be rendered in the RelatedMedia component.

The RelatedMedia component::
--In the play media page, beside the media loaded in the player, we will load a list of related media in the RelatedMedia component. The RelatedMedia component will
take the list of related media as a prop from the PlayMedia component and render the details along with a video snapshot of each video in the list,

Lecture 3:
The PlayMedia component::
--The PlayMedia component will render the play media page. This component consists
of the Media and RelatedMedia child components along with an autoplay toggle,
and it provides data to these components when it loads in the view.

--We will also discuss the implementation of
the handleAutoPlay method that will be passed as a prop to the Media component.
It will also receive the media detail object, and the video URL for the first item in the
related media list, which will be treated as the next URL to play
